Overview of All Our Families
The All Our Families Study is a longitudinal Calgary-based cohort that recruited 3,200 mother-baby pairs beginning in 2008. They have continued to follow these pairs for 
nearly 2 decades. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, they have collected data from women and youth independently. Their latest data collection occurred in 2023, when the 
youth were 12-14 years of age and the women were predominantly in their mid to late 40s.
